To make this version of dmapi work with JFS you'll first
need the JFS dmapi patch then add the corresponding jfs-dmapi-*-additional
patch from this directory.

The JFS dmapi patches can be found at IBM's website.  Their patch will make
JFS dmapi-capable, and will include a JFS-specific version of the dmapi core
in fs/jfs/dmapi:

http://www-124.ibm.com/developer/opensource/jfs/project/pub/dmapi/

Then, from this fs/dmapi/PATCHES directory add on the corresponding
jfs-dmapi-*-additional patch.  This patch will convert JFS to use this unified
version of DMAPI.  [Note, this assumes you are using SGI's XFS kernel tree at
http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/linux-2.6-xfs/]

Then use the same libdm that you use with your XFS dmapi applications.  You
should have libdm from dmapi-2.2.0 or later.

With these patches this unified DMAPI can manage XFS and JFS filesystems at
the same time, however SGI has not tested JFS with DMAPI.

The patch jfs-dmapi-2.6.7-additional applies to the 2.6.7 xfs linux kernel
tree on oss.sgi.com, on top of IBM's dmapi patch named jfs-dmapi-2.6.7-rc1 .

The patches under the tot-2.6.7-patches directory can be used to add dmapi to
the current top-of-tree Linux 2.6 kernel as it is found in BK at
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5.  You still need IBM's dmapi patch from
their website (mentioned above).

The patches under the 2.6.9-rc1-patches directory can be used to add dmapi to
the current top-of-tree Linux 2.6 kernel as it is found in BK at

their website (mentioned above).
