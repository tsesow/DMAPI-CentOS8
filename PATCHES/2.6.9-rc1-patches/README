The patches in this directory apply against the latest Linux 2.6 community
kernel to give it the unified DMAPI that works with both XFS and JFS.

This is considered experimental, and SGI does not test or support JFS with
DMAPI.

The bk repository for the latest Linux 2.6 community kernel is at
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5

These patches were tested on Linux 2.6.9-rc1, from the bk repository as of:
 Sep 2, 04?

This requires IBM's DMAPI patch, a copy of which has been provided here as a
convenience to anyone wanting to try out this code.  Their patch is named
jfs-dmapi-2.6.7-rc1.patch here, and was obtained from their website at
http://www-124.ibm.com/developer/opensource/jfs/project/pub/dmapi/.  It has
been slightly modified to apply to the JFS that is in the 2.6.9-rc1 kernel.

The 'series' file indicates the order in which the patches should be applied.
